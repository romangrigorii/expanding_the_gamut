# expanding_the_gamut_of_tactile_rendering_via_discretized_fingerpad_actuation

This repository contains the embedded code to program a PIC32 Microcontroller
which operated a 14DOF pin array apparatus and the code used to communicate with
the controller to render specific stimuli for psychophysics tests.
